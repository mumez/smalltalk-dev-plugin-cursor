# Smalltalk Developer Workflow

Implement the standard workflow for Pharo Smalltalk development using AI editors and the Tonel file format.

## Prerequisites

Before starting development, ensure the environment is ready:

- **No project structure** (no `src/` or `.project`): Use `smalltalk-dev:st-setup-project` skill to create boilerplate
- **Pharo not connected** or session not initialized: Use `smalltalk-dev:st-init` skill to verify connection and set up environment

## Core Development Cycle

The fundamental workflow for Smalltalk development consists of three steps that repeat:

### 1. Edit Tonel Files

Edit Tonel files directly in the AI editor. The AI editor is the **single source of truth** for code.

**Key principle**: All code changes happen in `.st` files, not in the Pharo image.

**Tonel basics:**
- One class per `.st` file
- File name matches class name
- Each package directory contains `package.st`

For detailed Tonel syntax and examples, see [Tonel Format Reference](references/tonel-format.md).

Follow the [Style Guide](references/style-guide.md) for idiomatic Smalltalk.

Refer to [Implementation Patterns](references/patterns.md) for common patterns (Singleton, Settings, etc.).

### 2. Import to Pharo

**Before importing**, run lint to check code quality:

```
/st-lint src/MyPackage   # Check Smalltalk best practices
```

Then import the package into the running Pharo image using absolute paths:

```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__import_package: 'MyPackage' path: '/home/user/project/src'
```

**Critical rules:**
- ✅ **Lint before import** - Check code quality first
- ✅ Always use **absolute paths** (never relative)
- ✅ Re-import after **every change**
- ✅ Import packages in **dependency order**
- ✅ Import test packages **after main packages**

### 3. Run Tests

After import, run tests to verify changes:

```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__run_class_test: 'MyClassTest'
mcp__smalltalk-interop__run_package_test: 'MyPackage-Tests'
```

If tests fail, return to step 1, fix the Tonel file, and repeat.

## Essential Best Practices

### Path Management

**Always use absolute paths for imports:**
```
✅ /home/user/myproject/src
❌ ./src
❌ ../myproject/src
```

**Finding the source directory:**
1. Check `.project` file for `srcDirectory` field
2. Common locations: `src/`, `repositories/`
3. Construct full path: `<project_root>/<srcDirectory>`

See [Best Practices Reference](references/best-practices.md#path-management) for details.

### Package Dependencies

Check `BaselineOf<ProjectName>` to determine correct import order:

```smalltalk
baseline: spec
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [
        spec
            package: 'MyPackage-Core';
            package: 'MyPackage-Json' with: [
                spec requires: #('MyPackage-Core')
            ]
    ]
```

**Import order**: Dependencies first → `MyPackage-Core` → `MyPackage-Json`

See [Best Practices: Dependencies](references/best-practices.md#package-dependencies-and-import-order) for complete guide.

### Import Timing

**Re-import after every change** - Pharo doesn't automatically reload files.

**Standard sequence:**
1. Edit `MyPackage/MyClass.st`
2. Import `MyPackage`
3. Edit `MyPackage-Tests/MyClassTest.st`
4. Import `MyPackage-Tests`
5. Run tests

### File Editing Philosophy

The AI editor is the source of truth:

- ✅ Edit `.st` files → Import to Pharo
- ❌ Edit in Pharo → Export to `.st` files

Use `export_package` only for:
- Initial project setup
- Emergency recovery
- Exploring existing code

See [Best Practices: File Editing](references/best-practices.md#file-editing-philosophy) for rationale.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Creating New Class

```
1. Ensure .project file exists in project root (create if missing - see Best Practices)
2. Create src/MyPackage/MyClass.st with class definition
3. import_package: 'MyPackage' path: '/absolute/path/src'
4. run_class_test: 'MyClassTest'
```

### Pattern 2: Adding Methods

```
1. Read existing src/MyPackage/MyClass.st
2. Add new method to file
3. import_package: 'MyPackage' path: '/absolute/path/src'
4. run_class_test: 'MyClassTest'
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Package Development

```
1. Check BaselineOf for dependency order
2. Import packages in correct sequence
3. Import test packages last
4. Run comprehensive tests
```

### Pattern 5: Renaming a Class

Renaming a class only in the Tonel file and importing leaves the old class in the Pharo image. Always rename in Pharo first, then import.

```
1. Rename the class in Pharo via eval:
   (OldClassName rename: 'NewClassName') printString

2. Update the Tonel filename and class name in the .st file

3. Import the package
   import_package: 'MyPackage' path: '/absolute/path/src'
```

**Why?** Tonel import creates or updates classes by name. If the old name still exists in the image and the new name is introduced as a new class, both will coexist — and any references to the old class remain broken.

### Pattern 4: Installing External Packages from GitHub

When a required package is **not present locally**, use `install_project` — never use Metacello directly via `eval`:

```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__install_project
  project_name: 'MyLib'
  repository_url: 'github://owner/MyLib:branch/src'
```

Parameters:
- `project_name` (required): the baseline/project name
- `repository_url` (required): Metacello-style URL (e.g. `github://owner/repo:branch/src`)
- `load_groups` (optional): comma-separated groups to load

**Critical rule**: If a class or package is missing and is not in the local source tree, **always reach for `install_project` first**. Do NOT try to load it with `Metacello new baseline:... load` via `eval` — that approach bypasses the managed workflow and can corrupt the image state.

For complete examples, see [Development Session Examples](examples/development-sessions.md).

## Automation

When this skill is active, automatically suggest:

1. **Import commands** after editing Tonel files
2. **Test commands** after successful import
3. **Debugging procedures** when tests fail

## Quick Reference

### MCP Tools

**Install external package (GitHub/remote):**
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__install_project
  project_name: 'MyLib'
  repository_url: 'github://owner/MyLib:branch/src'
```
> Use this when a package is not present locally. Never use Metacello via eval for this purpose.

**Import local package:**
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__import_package: 'PackageName' path: '/absolute/path'
```

**Test:**
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__run_class_test: 'TestClassName'
mcp__smalltalk-interop__run_package_test: 'PackageName-Tests'
```

**Debug:**
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__eval: 'Smalltalk code here'
```

**Validate (optional):**
```
mcp__smalltalk-validator__validate_tonel_smalltalk_from_file: '/path/to/file.st'
```

### Common Commands

- `/st-import PackageName /path` - Import package
- `/st-test TestClass` - Run tests
- `/st-eval code` - Execute Smalltalk snippet
- `/st-validate file.st` - Validate syntax

## Troubleshooting

### Import Fails

**"Package not found":**
- Verify absolute path is correct
- If using docker image (check by `docker ps`), use container-side path: typically `/root/repos` (check `compose.yml` for volume mounts)
- Ensure package name matches directory
- Check `package.st` exists in the directory

**"Syntax error":**
- Run `validate_tonel_smalltalk_from_file` first
- Check Tonel syntax (brackets, quotes, periods)

**"Dependency not found" / missing external package:**
- If the package is not in the local source tree, install it from GitHub:
  ```
  mcp__smalltalk-interop__install_project
    project_name: 'MyLib'
    repository_url: 'github://owner/MyLib:branch/src'
  ```
- Do **NOT** try `Metacello new baseline: ... load` via `eval` — use `install_project` instead
- If it is a local package, check Baseline for required packages and import dependencies first

### Tests Fail

1. Read error message carefully
2. Use `/st-eval` to debug incrementally
3. Fix in Tonel file (not Pharo)
4. Re-import and re-test

See [Best Practices: Error Handling](references/best-practices.md#error-handling-and-debugging) for complete guide.

## Summary Workflow

```
Edit .st file
    ↓
Lint code (/st-lint)
    ↓
Import package (absolute path)
    ↓
Run tests
    ↓
Tests pass? → Done
    ↓
Tests fail? → Debug with /st-eval → Fix .st file → Re-import
```

**Remember**: The cycle is Edit → Lint → Import → Test. Never skip lint, import, or tests.
