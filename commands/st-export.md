# Export Package from Pharo

Export a package from the running Pharo image back to Tonel files.

## Usage

```
/st-export PackageName /absolute/path/to/src
```

## Steps

1. Call `export_package` with package name and absolute path to the `src/` directory
2. Report the exported files or any error

## When to Use

Export is the exception, not the norm. Use only when Pharo has newer code than Tonel files:

- Fixed code in the Pharo debugger
- Generated boilerplate using Pharo tools
- Made changes directly in the Pharo browser

## Notes

- Normally, edit Tonel files and import — AI editor is the source of truth
- Export overwrites existing `.st` files in the directory
- Always use absolute paths

## Examples

```
/st-export MyPackage /home/user/project/src
/st-export MyPackage-Tests /home/user/project/src
```
