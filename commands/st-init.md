description: Pharo Smalltalk development session initializer. Use when starting a new Smalltalk development session, when Pharo connection needs to be established or verified, when the user asks about the development workflow or available commands, when development environment setup is needed, or when Docker or local Pharo installation is required.

# Initialize Smalltalk Development Session

Start a Pharo Smalltalk development session: verify project structure, confirm Pharo connection, and orient to the development workflow.

## Initialization Sequence

### 1. Check Project Structure

```bash
if [ ! -f ".project" ] && [ ! -d "src" ]; then
  echo "No Pharo project structure detected"
fi
```

- ✅ `.project` OR `src/` found → continue
- ⚠️ Neither found → recommend `smalltalk-dev:st-setup-project` skill

**If no project exists**, offer to create one:
```
⚠️  No Pharo project structure detected in current directory.

Use /st-setup-project MyProjectName to set up:
  • .project configuration file
  • src/ directory with package structure
  • BaselineOf class and Core/Tests packages

Would you like to run /st-setup-project now?
```

- **User says yes**: Invoke `smalltalk-dev:st-setup-project` skill, then continue with steps 2–4.
- **User says no / continue anyway**: Proceed directly to step 2 (load smalltalk-developer) without project setup. Note in the status report that project structure is missing.

### 2. Load smalltalk-developer Skill

Use the `Skill` tool to load `smalltalk-dev:smalltalk-developer`. This activates the full development workflow guidance.

### 3. Verify Pharo Connection

Run `Smalltalk version` via eval:

```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__eval: 'Smalltalk version'
```

- ✅ Returns version string → connected, proceed
- ❌ Fails or times out → follow [Connection Setup](#connection-setup) below

### 4. Confirm Ready

Report status to user:
```
✅ Pharo connected: Pharo X.Y (...)
✅ smalltalk-developer skill loaded
📋 Development workflow: Edit → Lint → Import → Test
```

## Connection Setup

If Pharo is not connected, check Docker availability first:

```bash
docker --version
```

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

Generate `compose.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
services:
  sis-pharo:
    image: mumez/smalltalk-interop-docker
    ports:
      - "5900:5900"
      - "6901:6901"
      - "8086:8086"
    environment:
      PHARO_SIS_PORT: 8086
    volumes:
      - /tmp:/root/screenshots
      - .:/root/repos
```

Then instruct the user:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Re-verify connection after startup.

### Local Pharo Installation

If Docker is not available or not preferred:

**1. Install Pharo:**
```bash
mkdir pharo-stable
cd pharo-stable
curl https://get.pharo.org | bash
```

**2. Load PharoSmalltalkInteropServer:**
```bash
./pharo Pharo.image metacello install github://mumez/PharoSmalltalkInteropServer:main/src BaselineOfPharoSmalltalkInteropServer
```

**3. Start Pharo (SisServer starts automatically):**
```bash
./pharo-ui
```

Re-verify connection after Pharo is running.

### Manual Start (Pharo already installed)

If Pharo is installed but server not running, ask user to execute in Pharo:
```smalltalk
SisServer current start
```

## Development Workflow Overview

The core cycle (full details in `smalltalk-dev:smalltalk-developer`):

```
Edit .st file
    ↓
Lint (/st-lint)
    ↓
Import package (absolute path)
    ↓
Run tests
    ↓
Pass? → Done  |  Fail? → Debug → Fix → Repeat
```

## Available Skills and Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/st-import PackageName /abs/path` | Import Tonel package to Pharo |
| `/st-test TestClass` | Run SUnit tests |
| `/st-eval code` | Execute Smalltalk snippet |
| `/st-export PackageName` | Export package from Pharo |
| `/st-lint src/PackageName` | Validate Smalltalk best practices |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| Connection timeout | Check if Pharo image is running |
| Server not started | Run `SisServer current start` in Pharo |
| Port mismatch | Check `PHARO_SIS_PORT` env var (default: 8086) |
| MCP issues | Verify `pharo-smalltalk-interop-mcp-server` is installed |
| Docker path issues | Check volume mounts in `compose.yml` |
