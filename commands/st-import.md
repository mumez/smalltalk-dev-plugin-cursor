# Import Tonel Package

Import edited Tonel files into the running Pharo image.

## Usage

```
/st-import PackageName /absolute/path/to/src
```

## Steps

1. Call `import_package` with package name and absolute path to the `src/` directory
2. Report success or error from the result

## Notes

- Always use absolute paths
- Use the **package parent directory** as the path — do not include the package name in the path
- Import main package before test package
- Re-import after every change

## Examples

```
/st-import RediStick-Json /home/user/git/RediStick/src
/st-import RediStick-Json-Tests /home/user/git/RediStick/src
```
