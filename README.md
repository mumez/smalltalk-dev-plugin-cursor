# smalltalk-dev Plugin

[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) plugin for AI-driven Smalltalk (Pharo) development.

> [Claude Code version](https://github.com/mumez/smalltalk-dev-plugin) is also available.

## Overview

This plugin provides a comprehensive AI-powered toolkit for Pharo Smalltalk development. It covers the full development lifecycle — from project setup and Tonel file editing, to importing, testing, debugging, and documentation generation.

## Features

- **Commands**: Essential slash commands for import, test, eval, and validation
- **Skills**: AI-powered development workflow, debugging expertise, and documentation
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless connection to Pharo and validation servers
- **Hooks**: Automatic suggestions after file changes

## Usage

### Quick Start

The easiest way to use this plugin is to use the **/st-buddy** command:

```bash
# Start Smalltalk Buddy (once per session)
/st-buddy

# Then ask questions naturally
You: "I want to create a Person class with name and age"
AI:  I'll help you create that! [Creates Tonel files and guides you through the process]

You: "How do I test this?"
AI:  Let me run the tests for you... [Executes tests and shows results]

You: "The test failed, can you help?"
AI:  I'll debug this... [Investigates, identifies issue, and fixes it]
```

**/st-buddy** is your friendly development partner that:
- Understands what you want to do and routes to the right tools
- Guides you through development, testing, and debugging
- Helps you learn AI-assisted Smalltalk development
- Works naturally through conversation

### Development Workflow

1. **Run /st-buddy** once at the start of your session
2. **Ask questions** naturally about what you want to do
3. **AI implements** and manages the workflow (editing Tonel, importing, testing)
4. **Review results** and continue the conversation
5. **Iterate** until you're satisfied

For experienced users who prefer direct commands, see [Commands.md](doc/Commands.md).

## Prerequisites

### 1. Pharo with PharoSmalltalkInteropServer

Choose one of the following options:

#### Option A: Use Docker (Easy)

Run a pre-configured Pharo image using [smalltalk-interop-docker](https://github.com/mumez/smalltalk-interop-docker):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Option B: Local Pharo Setup

Install [PharoSmalltalkInteropServer](https://github.com/mumez/PharoSmalltalkInteropServer) in your Pharo image.

### 2. Cursor

Install [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) from the official site.

### 3. uv

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which is used in MCP.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the plugin
/add-plugin smalltalk-dev
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, you should see the custom commands starting with `/st-`.

### Commands

The plugin provides essential commands for Smalltalk development:

- `/st-buddy` - Start your friendly Smalltalk development assistant (recommended starting point)
- `/st-init` - Load smalltalk-developer skill and explain workflow
- `/st-setup-project` - Set up Pharo project structure
- `/st-eval` - Execute Smalltalk code snippets
- `/st-lint` - Check code quality and best practices
- `/st-import` - Import Tonel packages to Pharo
- `/st-export` - Export packages from Pharo
- `/st-test` - Run SUnit tests
- `/st-validate` - Validate Tonel syntax

**Most users should start with /st-buddy** - it will guide you and use the other commands as needed.

For command details and advanced usage, see [Commands.md](doc/Commands.md).

### Skills

The plugin includes specialized AI skills that activate automatically based on your needs:

- **smalltalk-developer** - Development workflow and best practices
- **smalltalk-debugger** - Error handling and debugging procedures
- **smalltalk-usage-finder** - Code usage exploration and analysis
- **smalltalk-implementation-finder** - Implementation discovery and patterns
- **smalltalk-commenter** - CRC-style class documentation generation

**These skills work behind the scenes** when you use /st-buddy, providing specialized knowledge for each task.

#### /smalltalk-commenter (Documentation Skill)

Automatically suggests class documentation improvements:

- Detects undocumented classes after file changes (occasionally, not every time)
- Generates CRC-style class comments
- Can be invoked directly: `/smalltalk-commenter`

**Works quietly in the background** - you'll get occasional suggestions to improve documentation.

### MCP Tools

The plugin exposes all tools from both MCP servers:

**pharo-interop** (22 tools):
- `eval`: Execute Smalltalk expressions
- `import_package`, `export_package`: Package management
- `run_class_test`, `run_package_test`: Test execution
- `get_class_source`, `get_method_source`: Code inspection
- `search_implementors`, `search_references`: Code navigation
- And more...

**smalltalk-validator** (5 tools):
- `validate_tonel_smalltalk_from_file`: File validation
- `validate_tonel_smalltalk`: Content validation
- `validate_smalltalk_method_body`: Method validation
- `lint_tonel_smalltalk_from_file`: File linting
- `lint_tonel_smalltalk`: Content linting

## Configuration

The plugin uses two MCP servers:

1. **pharo-interop**: Communication with Pharo image
2. **smalltalk-validator**: Tonel syntax validation

These are configured automatically via `.mcp.json`. You can customize the Pharo port:

```bash
export PHARO_SIS_PORT=8086  # default
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove the plugin
/remove-plugin smalltalk-dev
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Edit** Tonel files (AI editor is the source of truth)
2. **Lint** code with `/st-lint` to check quality
3. **Import** to Pharo with absolute paths
4. **Test** after every import

### Code Quality
- Use `/st-lint` before importing to catch issues early
- Add class prefixes to avoid name collisions
- Keep methods focused (15 lines standard, 40 for UI/tests)
- Limit instance variables (max 10 per class)
- Access instance variables through methods, not directly

### Path Management
- Always use absolute paths for imports
- Import multiple packages individually

### File Editing
- **AI editor is the source of truth** (Tonel files)
- Avoid editing in Pharo directly
- Use `export_package` only when necessary

### Import Timing
- Re-import after every change
- Import main package before test package
- Don't forget to import test packages

### Testing
- Run tests after every import
- Use `run_class_test` for specific classes
- Use `run_package_test` for full packages

### Debugging
- Use `/st-eval` for quick partial execution
- Capture both results and errors in Array
- Use `printString` for object serialization
- Debug step-by-step

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" error

Make sure PharoSmalltalkInteropServer is running:

```smalltalk
SisServer current start.
SisServer current.  "Should show running server"
```

### "Package not found" after import

- Verify absolute path is correct
- Check that .st files are in correct directory
- Ensure package.st exists

### Tests fail after import

1. Check test error message
2. Use `/st-validate` to check syntax
3. Use `/st-eval` to debug specific code
4. Fix in Tonel file
5. Re-import and re-test

### Import seems to do nothing

- Check Pharo Transcript for error messages
- Verify server port matches configuration: `SisServer teapotConfig`
- Try `/st-eval Smalltalk version` to test connection
